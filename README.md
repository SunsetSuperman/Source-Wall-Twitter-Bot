# Source-Wall-Twitter-Bot
A Twitter bot designed to manage my comic book news Twitter page, The Source Wall, by scanning Twitter for posts fitting a certain criteria and retweeting them. Future plans for the bot hope to see an automatic response system to greet new followers through IM and automate tweets on certain anniversary dates (first appearance of Superman, Stan Lee's death, etc.)

The bot was developed using the Tweepy library and coded in Python 3.
